  ## Product Description
  This project is an AI-powered educational platform that offers personalized subject explanations based on students' learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) and personality traits. Using student profiles, the GPT-based system generates dynamic content and provides features such as voice-based feedback, mini quizzes, mental fatigue analysis, and personalized PDF booklets. The goal is to enhance learning efficiency through tailored instruction and reduce educational inequality.

  - **Sprint Notes**:
    - It has been decided to use 'Flask' for the web framework.
      
    - It has been decided to use 'Gemini API' for personalized content generation.
      
    - It has been decided to use 'SQLite' as the local database, integrated with `SQLAlchemy`.

    - A user input form has been created to collect:
      - `name`
      - 6 learning style-related questions.
        
    - It has been decided to use 'Bootstrap 5' for responsive UI styling.
      
    - User profile data is stored in a `Flask session` and passed to the next page.
      
    - A second page allows entering a topic and fetches an AI-generated explanation based on the user's learning style.
      
    - All user inputs and AI responses are logged to the database for future reference.
      
    - The project uses `.env` and `dotenv` for secure API key handling.
- **Expected Point Completion within Sprint**: 200 points  
- **Point Completion Logic**:  
  The first sprint had a target of '200 points'.  

  The core focus was:
- Setting up the Flask project (40 pts)
- Designing the user form page (30 pts)
- Implementing the database schema (30 pts)
- Integrating the Gemini API (40 pts)
- Creating the explanation (output) page (30 pts)
- Calculating learning style & managing session data (20 pts)
- UI/UX polishing, routing improvements, and testing (10 pts)

  > A total of '200 points' worth of work has been completed.

  - **Sprint Review:**
    - Arda and Burak carried out a coordinated effort for the backend and frontend. We have agreed within the team to continue this way in the next sprint.

    - We struggled to decide on an application name for a while. We transitioned from 'zaten' to 'zaten' and took another step towards branding by purchasing the 'zaten.app' domain for the name.

    - The two biggest problems we encountered in this sprint were difficulty in deciding on a color palette and not having completed the logo yet.

    - We learned that the FloatingActionButton usage in the BottomNavigationBar and the notched feature of the navigation bar have been removed in Material 3, we overcame this issue by designing it ourselves.

    - Overall, we believe we had a good sprint process. We experienced a sprint process close to what we planned.

  - **Sprint Review Participants:** `Burak Taha Cevheroğlu`, `Arda Demirel`, `Dila Hazal Bilgin`, `Merve Ağaçayak`, `Onur Konuk`
  - **Sprint Retrospective:**
    - In the second sprint, it was decided in the team meeting that only Arda and Burak would write code for mobile.

    - In the second sprint, we decided to write our own API (for location information).

    - We had to postpone the logo design to the second sprint. We will continue with the design.

    - We will continue to develop the local database system (Hive).

    - As Burak and Arda will continue more with software related tasks, much of the project management has been delegated to the remaining team members.

    - In the second sprint, we will start writing a website for the zaten.app domain we bought for brand recognition. This task has been handed over to Onur.

    - It was decided to establish a review system before the product goes live during the second sprint.

    - For brand recognition and marketing purposes, it was decided to open an Instagram account during the second sprint.

    - In addition to email authentication, it was decided to add the Google auth system in the second sprint.

    - It was decided to add test AdMobs in the second sprint.

    - We decided to start localization and the first languages will be English and Turkish.

    - It was decided to add a user-to-user SDK with the Stream Chat SDK in the second sprint.

  - **Sprint Notes**:
    - The internationalization system has been updated. The number of supported languages has been increased from 4 to 7.
    - We have enabled guest login to the application and integrated it into our system.

  - **Sprint Review**:
    - We have developed the Notification System that enables users to communicate with each other using onesignal and firestore technologies.
    - As mentioned, we developed the messaging system using the Stream SDK. We have also added the feature that users can share their instant locations with each other during messaging using the Google Maps and Google Maps service. (Google Maps Static API)
    - We successfully created a Payment&Wallet System by leveraging the combined power of Stripe, Riverpod, and Firestore. By integrating Stripe's robust payment infrastructure, Riverpod's efficient state management, and Firestore's scalable database, our system ensures a reliable and user-friendly experience for handling payments and managing digital wallets.
    - We created a review system using Firestore, where users can read and give feedback on each other's experiences. This system allows users to rate and comment on the things they have rented, helping others make better decisions based on shared opinions.
    - The languages we've added to our application are; Turkish, English, French, Japanese, Spanish, Hebrew, and German.
  - **Sprint Review Participants:** `Burak Taha Cevheroğlu`, `Arda Demirel`, `Dila Hazal Bilgin`, `Merve Ağaçayak`, `Onur Konuk`
